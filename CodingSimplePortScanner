- In video 2.1, where a simple code to check if port was opened was built.
A python code that establishes connection and checks if specific port number
is closed or opened for a server. 
- The socket package in python was used to establish the connection.
After importation, an object was created to handle the function for operation

Code:

import socket

host = "10.10.0.126"
port = 443 (https)

soc = socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)

def portscanner(port):
	if soc.connect_ex((host, port)):
		Print ("Port %d is closed!" % (port))
	else:
		print ("Port %d is opened!" % (port))

portscanner(port)
